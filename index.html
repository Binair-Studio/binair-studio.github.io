        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            We are a passionate indie game development team, based on the collaboration of creative minds from different corners of the world. Our heart beats for the development of unique game experiences that inspire players of all ages and transport them to other worlds.

          </p>
          <p>
            Specializing in Roblox Studio, our goal is to create games that are not only entertaining, but also innovative and educational. Our work is characterized by a deep passion for richly detailed worlds, thoughtful gameplay mechanics and intuitive user interfaces. We strongly believe that every game should tell a story that touches and challenges players at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we have also worked with Unreal Engine 4 in the past, an unexpected loss of our UE4 projects inspired us to invest even more of our resources and creativity into development with Roblox Studio. This challenge has strengthened us as a team and sharpened our focus to continue testing and pushing the boundaries of what is possible on the Roblox platform.
          </p>
          <p>

            We are currently hard at work on our first major project, a game that pushes the boundaries of Roblox and creates a deep, immersive experience for our players. Every element, from story to design, is being carefully considered and implemented to create a world that is both inviting and challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we bring a diverse range of skills and experience, from game design and programming to UI/UX design, storytelling and 3D asset modeling. This diversity allows us to bring unique perspectives to our projects and create games that excel both technically and artistically.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are only at the beginning of our journey and are eager to turn our visions into reality and enrich the gaming world with our creations. Our indie game development team is not just a group of developers - we are dreamers, artists and storytellers dedicated to creating unforgettable gaming experiences.

              <p class="timeline-text">
                Since 2022 we have focused on development with Roblox Studio, complemented by 3D modeling and animation in Blender. This combination has allowed us to create custom assets and give our games a unique visual identity in Roblox. Through Roblox Studio, we have learned how to create games that are both accessible and in-depth, reaching a wide audience. The integration of Blender has further enhanced our ability to create detailed and engaging game worlds, making our projects stand out in the Roblox community.

              <p class="timeline-text">
                After starting with Scratch, we switched to Unreal Engine, one of the most advanced game development platforms. Between 2020 and 2022, we worked intensively with Unreal Engine, which allowed us to gain deep insights into 3D game development, realistic environments and complex gameplay mechanics. During this time, we developed several prototypes and projects that expanded our technical know-how and creative vision, even though these projects no longer exist.

              <p class="timeline-text">
                Our journey into game development began in early 2020 with Scratch, a visual programming language that allowed us to learn the basics of logic and interactivity in games. Through working with Scratch, we developed a solid understanding of basic programming concepts and the importance of user engagement, which laid the foundation for our further development projects.

                  Welcome to SCP: Roleplay Adventure!

                  In this realm, the earth is inhabited by SCPs, entities that are either fearsome or defy normalcy. To safeguard humanity from these beings, the establishment of the SCP Foundation was necessary. This Foundation engages in research to deepen our understanding of the SCPs, with a primary goal to secure, contain, and protect them from posing a threat.
                  
                  Embark on a journey as a Detainee (Class - D), a Researcher, a Security Officer, or discover additional roles as you advance through the game.
                  
                  Will you aid in the Foundation's cause, or will you unleash turmoil upon the world?
                  
                  [!] Work In Progress [!]
